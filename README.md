 Glaucoma Detection using Fundus Images

This project is focused on the early detection of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, through the analysis of fundus images of the eye. Glaucoma is a progressive condition where damage to the optic nerve leads to vision loss, and early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment.

In this project, we employ deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify fundus images as either normal or indicative of glaucoma. The dataset consists of labeled fundus images, and the model is trained to identify key features in the images that correspond to glaucomatous changes in the eye.

The primary goals of the project include:
- Image preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality.
- Training a machine learning model (CNN) to detect glaucoma.
- Evaluating the performance of the model with accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Optionally, exposing the model as a web application using Flask and ngrok for easy accessibility.

This project serves as an important step towards creating an automated system for glaucoma screening, making it accessible for timely detection in clinical settings.
